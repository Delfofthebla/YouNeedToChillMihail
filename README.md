# You Need to CHILL Mihail

A Synthesis patcher for Skyrim that can reduce (or increase??) damage and health dealt by enemies that are added in Mihail's monster mods.

This patcher works by applying a blanket percentage nerf against all mihail mob damage and health values. I just look for any plugin with the word 'mihail' in it and apply the nerfs to any races or npcs defined in that mod. It might miss some stuff, it might hit some things you don't want it to. I have an ignored mods / form id blacklist settings in the configs but I never found a need to use them so they are completely untested.

### Justification

Listen, I love Mihail's mods just as much as the next guy, but they are all way too tanky and they do way too much damage. My combat setups usually have combat moving pretty fast in general, and Mihail's mods just didn't fit in that mold. The number of times I've spent fighting a minotaur for over a minute only to have it oneshot me due to a single mistake--yeah, no. It was time for ACTION.

And now I have this patcher.
